This is the final project for the Data Mining class

In this project, I did scrape the data from Twitter about Web3, NFT, Metaverse, and cryptocurrency.

Web3 was 60932 tweets  from November 24 / 2021 to December 3 / 2021
NFT was 22041 tweets  from December 2 / 2021
Metaverse 40818 tweets from December 1 / 2021 to December 2 / 2021
cryptocurrency was 79743 tweets from November 29 / 2021 to December 2 / 2021

The second experiment was about cryptocurrency only and was 71719 tweets from December 3 / 2021 to December 5 / 2021

the dataset columns are:
date , username, tweet, hashtags, nlikes, language, search, time


twitter_analysis_data (1).ipynb is the main project with both Sentiment Analysis and Machine Learning.

twitter_analysis_data (2).ipynb is just to see the Sentiment Analysis about cryptocurrency around the time when the drops happened on December 4 /2021.
